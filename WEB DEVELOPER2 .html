<p>The field of web development has grown rapidly over the years.<br>
It still has scope for improvements but may not have major innovations any time soon.<br>
  Being a web developer today is not the same as it was ten years ago. Previously, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript,<BR>
   And such other languages as well as knowing frameworks like Ruby on Rails could get one a prospective career as a web developer.<br>
    Today, however, this is not the case primarily because there are many developers out there who have these skills.<br>
	 A web developer now must have what it takes to build websites and applications that are innovative and out of the box.<br>
	 
	 
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
	 
<P> It is possible to make a career in web development in 2020,
 the process is more complicated than you think. Since the mere knowledge of basic programming languages will not do,<br>
  It is essential to have a competitive edge and skill sets that make you different and out of the ordinary. Today,<br>
   It is also not just about learning tried and tested programming languages and frameworks.<br>
    It is also essential to learn new languages and frameworks that have huge potentials and are yet to be popular.<br>
	 The scope for these is high because they can be experimented with,<br>
	  And they may have features that do not exist in traditional languages or frameworks.<br>
	  
	  
	  
	  <BR>
	  <BR>
	  
	  
	  
	  <P>In recent years, JavaScript, Python and PHP have been the most popular programming languages.<br>
	   While learning JavaScript and Python in 2020 is necessary, it may not be the case with PHP.<br>
	    Python is not the ideal language for mobile applications,<br>
		 Yet its robust features and the ability to build web applications for browsers continue to retain its popularity.<br>
		  PHP seems to have taken a back seat because it does not have what it takes to build modern web applications.<br>
		   However, it is easy to learn and use, and so it is still a choice of some developers.<br>
